Launching and Setting up of AWS EC2 Instance

Step 1

I signed in to my Aws account

Step 2

I created an IAM user : Aws don't recommend accessing the EC2 instance with an aws account credentials, so i needed to create an AWS Identity and Access Management (AIM) user and add it to an IAM group.

Step 3

I created an administrator user and added the user to an administrator group, then i created a user password.

Step 4

I created a Key pair : a key pair is like a secure log in for the instance. I chose a aprticular region, before creating the key pair because a key pair must be created for a particular instance in a particular region.

Step 5

Creating a VPC : an EC2 Instance has to be located in a virtual private cloud, but in this case, there was already a default vpc

Step 6

Chose a launch template and instance type

Step 7

Launched the Instance.
