Launching and Setting up of AWS EC2 Instance

Step 1

Sign in to your Aws account or sign up if you don't have one already

Step 2

Create an IAM user : Aws don't recommend accessing the EC2 instance with an aws account credentials, so you need to create an AWS Identity and Access Management (AIM) user and add it to an IAM group.

Step 3

Create an administrator user and add the user to an administrator group, then  create a user password.

Step 4

Create a Key pair : a key pair is like a secure log in for the instance. Choose a aprticular region, before creating the key pair because a key pair must be created for a particular instance in a particular region.

Step 5

Creating a VPC : an EC2 Instance has to be located in a virtual private cloud, but in this case, there is already a default vpc

Step 6

Choose a launch template and instance type

Step 7

Launch the Instance.
